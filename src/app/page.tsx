If you do any custom coding it's important to work with someone like Ewa who will make sure it's done right from the beginning. We made the mistake of working with other developers on here that built code and store that is riddled with coding issues. So you may get something that works at the time but later falls a part, is super slow, unsecure or runs into several issues when making updates/changes. So you end up spending much more time, money, and headaches in the long run. Ewa was able to organize our site/coding and clean things up. She was by far the most knowledgeable developer we worked with. She also is a great designer and can assure the site looks as good as it performs. If you need a pro developer or designer, work with Ewa."`}</p>
